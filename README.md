# Certified-Kubernetes-Admin-Prep

I'm familiar with Kubernetes, as I've worked with it in a number of different settings for years, but only recently did I endeavor to get my CKA certificate. In doing so, I noticed that there are paid resources strewn across the web, but I would rather leverage the tools available to spin up my own clusters and practice the range of skills required to pass the exam. 

This resource is intended to save folks the legwork of generating your own resources as I am, cause, you know, why not? :) 

NOTE: This resource is currently under construction.  

## Getting Started

Regardless of the specific practice scenario you select, it will always begin with a common first step of spinning up a bare metal K8s cluster on Digital Ocean Droplets as described in detail in my first accompanying blog post, "[Bare Metal K8s on Ubuntu 24.04](https://medium.com/@jeff.d.vincent/bare-metal-k8s-cluster-for-dummies-fc3616b2debb)". 

## Practice Scenario 1

You can find all related resources in the Practice Scenario 1 directory.
